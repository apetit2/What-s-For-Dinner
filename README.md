## NOTE
**You will need a .env and specified .json to run the server, this can be provided upon request but will not post this up here because it contains api information and other confidential crap that should not be made public.**
**Additionally, you will need a specified config.properties file to run the client. There are examples for how to construct both the .env and the config.properties so that you can figure out how to actual work with this code.**
