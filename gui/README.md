# What-s-For-Dinner
Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing Final Project

##Use
This is the code for the android gui of the project. It is used to provide an interface for users to search for recipes by ingredients they 
already have. To actually run this, you need to ensure that you have java 1.8 installed on your computer in addition to android studio. In
addition, you will need to create a config.properties file that can be modeled after the sample-config.properties file provided in the 
src/resources directory. Once this is done, you can simply run the application in Android Studio or on your physical device assuming you 
meet the requirements for the sdk version.
