# What-s-For-Dinner
Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing Final Project

##Use:
This server code is used to provide an interface between the client and the rest api/database. It is easily configureable to whatever 
settings you desire, by creating a .env file that should be modeled after the sample.env. Once you have all the necessary configurations,
you can install all dependencies by typing the command 'npm install' assuming that you already have nodeJS installed. From here, it's as 
simple as typing 'npm start' to start this server.
